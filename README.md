# Ethereum-JSON-Store

Ethereum json store is a tool for sharing API data.Now with one API key many users can access the data.

# How it Works ?

The user needs to put in his ETH address,private key and the API whose data he wants to share.As soon as user submits the data the API would be called and the fetched data would be save to the smart contract via Web3.js.And now any other user would be able to call the data from the smart contract without any hassle of getting or buying an api key.
